# Project 1: Linked Lists in C and java

The goal of this project is to implement a linked list to store location information in c and java. Each node in the list takes three parameters: name, latitude, longitude, and next (ie the next element).

The list implementation can be found in llist.c, llist.h, LList.java, and LNode.java.

Additionally, a series of tests is performed on each list to ensure it is fully functional. This includes tests for the following list actions: sort, add, remove, and clear.

The project description is available here:

```
  make c
  make runc
```

To build and run the Java code (specifically tests) use in the command prompt:
```
  make java
  make runjava
```
